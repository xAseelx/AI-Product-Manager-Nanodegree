<h1 style="font-weight:bold" > Stocky </h1>

This project is part of the Measuring Impact and Updating Models course under my Nanodegree in AI Product Manager Program.
Project Overview

This project is a business proposal addressing the challenge of managing vast amounts of financial data and making timely, accurate investment decisions. Investors often face information overload, emotional biases, and inefficiencies that can significantly impact their returns.
Business Goal

The Stocky project aims to empower investors by utilizing machine learning and artificial intelligence to automate investment decisions, analyze financial data, and predict market trends. By reducing biases and enhancing response times, Stocky will provide optimized investment strategies, leading to improved risk management and better returns.
Success Metrics

The success of the Stocky project will be measured by the following metrics:

    Portfolio Return on Investment (ROI): The percentage gain or loss on the portfolio managed by the AI model over a specific period.
    Customer Retention Rate: The percentage of customers who continue using the AI investment service over time.
    Under Management (AUM) Growth: The increase in the total value of assets managed by the AI model.
    User Engagement Metrics: Measures of website-specific interactions, such as session duration and conversion rates.

## Data

The Stocky project will require a diverse dataset, including:

    Market Data: Stock prices, trading volumes, and financial statements sourced from platforms like Bloomberg and Yahoo Finance.
    News & Sentiment: Financial news and social media sentiment analysis.
    Economic Indicators: Macroeconomic data from government agencies and financial institutions.

Data will be collected continuously to ensure timely and accurate decision-making, with a focus on data privacy and security.
Model

The Stocky AI model will be built using a combination of in-house data science expertise and advanced machine learning frameworks. The in-house development approach ensures control over the modelâ€™s design and alignment with business goals, while maintaining data security.
Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

The initial MVP of Stocky will offer the following core functionalities:

    A user-friendly web interface for inputting financial data and investment parameters.
    Automatic generation of investment recommendations based on predictive analytics.
    Real-time updates and insights on market trends.
    Secure handling of user data with robust privacy controls.

## Post-MVP Deployment

After the initial launch of the MVP, the Stocky team will continuously monitor performance and user feedback to inform future iterations. Key responsibilities will include:

    Ongoing Model Optimization: Regular updates and retraining of the AI model to enhance prediction accuracy and investment recommendation quality.
    Implementation of Advanced Features: Development of features such as automated trading systems, personalized investment strategies, and integration with popular financial tools.
    Expansion of Supported Data Types: Increasing the variety of financial data sources and analytics capabilities to improve decision-making.
    Proactive Monitoring of Model Biases: Regular audits of the AI model to identify and mitigate biases, ensuring fair and equitable outcomes for all users.

## Conclusion

By leveraging the power of AI and a comprehensive understanding of financial markets, the Stocky project aims to transform how investors make decisions. This innovative approach will enhance investment strategies, reduce emotional biases, and ultimately lead to improved financial outcomes, fostering greater efficiency and trust in the investment process.
