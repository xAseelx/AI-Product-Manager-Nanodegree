This Nanodegree included 3 projects which are:
</br>
Project 1: </br>
[Project 1 Create a Medical Image Annotation Job](https://github.com/xAseelx/AI-Product-Manager-Nanodegree/tree/Project-1-Create-a-Medical-Image-Annotation-Job) </br></br>
**Detailed Explanation provided in the Project's Readme File** </br></br>
**General Explanation of the project:**
In this project my goal, as a product owner is to build a product that helps doctors quickly identify cases of pneumonia in children. I build a classification system that:
</br>
• Can help flag serious cases
</br>
• Quickly identify healthy cases
</br>
• And, generally, act as a diagnostic aid for doctors
</br></br>


Project 2:</br>
[Project 2 Build a Model With AWS Rekognition](https://github.com/xAseelx/AI-Product-Manager-Nanodegree/tree/Project-2-Build-a-Model-With-AWS-Rekognition)</br></br>
**Detailed Explanation provided in the Project's Readme File** </br></br>
**General Explanation of the project:**
In this project, we are going to take the next step and build the classification model that would serve as the backbone of this product. (Don't worry, there's no coding involved!) For this task, we will use Google AutoML, an automated machine learning tool that will allow us to build the model and host it in the cloud. In order to appreciate how training data impact models, we will build models with 4 variants of the dataset. This project is designed to test your ability to :

  build a model using Google's AutoML Vision platform, and
    understand how properties of data impact performance of models.

For the accomplishment of the project, you'll build four models using Google Cloud AutoML with four different variations on a medical imaging dataset. You'll have the opportunity to observe how properties of the data impact the models' results.


Project 3:</br>
[Project 3 Creating an AI Product Business Proposal](https://github.com/xAseelx/AI-Product-Manager-Nanodegree/tree/Project-3-Creating-an-AI-Product-Business-Proposal)</br></br>
**Detailed Explanation provided in the Project's Readme File** </br></br>
**General Explanation of the project:**
In this project, I developed a business proposal for an AI product "STOCKY". There are several important aspects of product development I needed to think about and describe, and they are exactly the topics covered in the Nanodegree final course.
